# IKS Vulnerability Advisor

## Challenge for today:

Find the vulnerabilities in the container images using vulnerability advisor on IBM Kubernetes service. Complete the following steps:

1. Sign up/Log in to [IBM Cloud](https://ibm.biz/Bdqqkx)
2. Create a kubernetes cluster on IBM Cloud
3. Push the container images into your private registry
4. Use vulnerability advisor to find the common CVEs

Use the following reference steps

## Provisioning IKS(IBM Kubernetes Service)

1. Login to you [IBM Cloud account](https://ibm.biz/Bdqqkx)

2. Go to [here](https://developer.ibm.com/callforcode/featurecode) to get a promo code, login to your IBM Cloud account, enter the code developer2020 to get a promo code.

Copy the feature code

3. Go to [IBM Cloud](https://ibm.biz/Bdqqkx)

Click on Manage, select Account.

You have successfully provisioned a Kubernetes cluster on IBM Cloud. Creation of cluster will take 15-20 minutes. Once the cluster is up and running, create a namespace and push the following images to see the vulnerabilities in them.

## Find the vulnerabilities in the following images

1. [phpldapadmin](https://hub.docker.com/r/vulnerables/phpldapadmin-remote-dump)

2. [metasploit](https://hub.docker.com/r/vulnerables/metasploit-vulnerability-emulator)

3. The following is the sample list
